# Public-Health-Awareness (Phase 1)
 Empowering communities through data-driven awareness.

## Project Definition

The Public Health Awareness Project involves analyzing data from public health awareness campaigns to measure their effectiveness in reaching the target audience and increasing awareness. The objective is to provide insights that evaluate the impact of the campaigns and inform future strategies. This project includes defining analysis objectives, collecting campaign data, designing relevant visualizations in IBM Cognos, and using code for data analysis.

## Design Thinking Approach

**1. Empathize:**

- Understand the health challenges faced by different communities.
- Gather data on prevalent diseases, healthcare accessibility, and community needs.
- Listen to the stories and experiences of individuals affected by health disparities.

**2. Define:**

- Clearly define the problem: "How might we raise public health awareness and improve healthcare access for underserved communities?"
- Identify key health indicators, vulnerable populations, and critical public health issues.

**3. Ideate:**

- Brainstorm potential solutions, including digital platforms, educational campaigns, and community outreach programs.
- Consider using data analytics and AI-driven insights to personalize health information.

**4. Prototype:**

- Develop a prototype of a user-friendly public health awareness platform.
- Create sample educational materials and content that resonate with diverse audiences.

**5. Test:**

- Pilot the prototype in a selected community to assess its effectiveness.
- Collect feedback from community members, healthcare professionals, and stakeholders.

**6. Implement:**

- Deploy the public health awareness platform and educational materials.
- Collaborate with local healthcare providers and community organizations.

**7. Learn:**

- Continuously monitor the platform's performance and gather user feedback.
- Adapt and expand the platform based on community needs and feedback.

## Conclusion

The Public Health Awareness project represents a commitment to addressing critical health disparities and empowering communities through informed decision-making. Leveraging the Design Thinking approach, we aim to develop a holistic solution that combines technology, data, and community engagement to raise awareness about public health issues and improve healthcare accessibility.
